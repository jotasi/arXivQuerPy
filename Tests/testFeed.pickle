VParallel combinations of adaptive filters have been effectively used to\u000aimprove the performance of adaptive algorithms and address typical trade-offs,\u000asuch as the one between convergence rate and steady-state error. In these\u000acombinations, the component filters are usually run independently and then\u000acombined, which leads to a well known convergence stagnation effect.\u000aConditional transfers of coefficients between filters were introduced in an\u000aattempt to handle this issue. This work introduces a more natural way of\u000aaccelerating convergence to steady-state by cyclically feeding back the overall\u000acoefficients to all component filters. Besides coping with convergence\u000astagnation, this new topology allows several adaptive algorithms (e.g., mixed\u000anorm, data reusing, and variable step size) to be posed as combinations of\u000asimple adaptive filters, bridging an important conceptual gap. Steady-state and\u000atracking analysis accounting for a myriad of component filters are derived for\u000acombinations with and without feedback.

VIn multivariate pattern analysis of neuroimaging data, 'second-level'\u000ainference is often performed by entering classification accuracies into a\u000a$t$-test vs chance level across subjects. We argue that while the\u000arandom-effects analysis implemented by the $t$-test does provide population\u000ainference if applied to activation differences, it fails to do so in the case\u000aof classification accuracy or other 'information-like' measures, because the\u000atrue value of such measures can never be below chance level. This constraint\u000achanges the meaning of the population-level null hypothesis being tested, which\u000abecomes equivalent to the global null hypothesis that there is no effect in any\u000asubject in the population. Consequently, rejecting it only allows to infer that\u000athere are some subjects in which there is an information effect, but not that\u000ait generalizes, rendering it effectively equivalent to fixed-effects analysis.\u000aThis statement is supported by theoretical arguments as well as simulations. We\u000areview possible alternative approaches to population inference for\u000ainformation-based imaging, converging on the idea that it should not target the\u000amean, but the prevalence of the effect in the population. One method to do so,\u000a'permutation-based information prevalence inference using the minimum\u000astatistic', is described in detail and applied to empirical data.

VCollagen fibril cross-sectional radii show no systematic variation between\u000athe interior and the periphery of fibril bundles, indicating an effectively\u000aconstant rate of collagen incorporation into fibrils throughout the bundle.\u000aSuch spatially homogeneous incorporation constrains the extracellular diffusion\u000aof collagen precursors from sources at the bundle boundary to sinks at the\u000agrowing fibrils. With a coarse-grained diffusion equation we determine\u000astringent bounds, using parameters extracted from published experimental\u000ameasurements of tendon development. From the lack of new fibril formation after\u000abirth, we further require that the concentration of diffusing precursors stays\u000abelow the critical concentration for fibril nucleation. We find that the\u000acombination of the diffusive bound, which requires larger concentrations to\u000aensure homogeneous fibril radii, and lack of nucleation, which requires lower\u000aconcentrations, is only marginally consistent with fully-processed collagen\u000ausing conservative bounds. More realistic bounds may leave no consistent\u000aconcentrations. Therefore, we propose that unprocessed pC-collagen diffuses\u000afrom the bundle periphery followed by local C-proteinase activity and\u000asubsequent collagen incorporation at each fibril. We suggest that C-proteinase\u000ais localized within bundles, at fibril surfaces, during radial fibrillar\u000agrowth. The much greater critical concentration of pC-collagen, as compared to\u000afully-processed collagen, then provides broad consistency between homogeneous\u000afibril radii and the lack of fibril nucleation during fibril growth.

VNear-Eddington accretion rates onto low-mass black holes are thought to be a\u000aprime driver of the multi-wavelength properties of the narrow-line Seyfert 1\u000a(NLS1) population of active galactic nuclei (AGN). Orientation effects have\u000arepeatedly been considered as another important factor involved, but detailed\u000astudies have been hampered by the lack of measured viewing angles towards this\u000atype of AGN. Here we present multi-epoch, 15 GHz VLBA images (MOJAVE program)\u000aof the radio-loud and Fermi/LAT-detected NLS1 galaxy 1H 323+342. These are\u000acombined with single-dish, multi-frequency radio monitoring of the source's\u000avariability, obtained with the Effelsberg 100-m and IRAM 30-m telescopes, in\u000athe course of the F-GAMMA program. The VLBA images reveal 6 components with\u000aapparent peeds of ~1 to ~7 c, and one quasi-stationary feature. Combining the\u000aobtained apparent jet speed ($\u005cbeta_{app}$) and variability Doppler factor\u000a($D_{var}$) estimates together with other methods, we constrain the viewing\u000aangle towards 1H 0323+342 to $\u005ctheta \u005cleq 4 - 13$ deg. Using literature values\u000aof $\u005cbeta_{app}$ and $D_{var}$, we also deduce a viewing angle of $\u005cleq$ 8-9\u000adeg towards another radio- and {\u005cgamma}-ray-loud NLS1, namely SBS 0846+513.

VADC non-linearities are a major systematic effect in the search for keV-scale\u000asterile neutrinos with tritium $\u005cbeta$-decay experiments like KATRIN. They can\u000asignificantly distort the spectral shape and thereby obscure the tiny kink-like\u000asignature of a sterile neutrino. In this work we demonstrate various mitigation\u000atechniques to reduce the impact of ADC non-linearities on the tritium\u000a$\u005cbeta$-decay spectrum to a level of $<$ ppm. The best results are achieved\u000awith a multi-pixel ($\u005cgeq10^4$ pixels) detector using full waveform\u000adigitization. In this case, active-to-sterile mixing angles of the order of\u000a$\u005csin^2 \u005ctheta = 10^{-7}$ would be accessible from the viewpoint of ADC\u000anon-linearities. With purely peak-sensing ADCs a comparable sensitivity could\u000abe reached with highly linear ADCs, sufficient non-linearity corrections or by\u000aincreasing the number of pixels to $\u005cgeq 10^5$.

VImpact of ADC non-linearities on the sensitivity to sterile keV\u000a  neutrinos with a KATRIN-like experiment

VADC non-linearities are a major systematic effect in the search for keV-scale\u000asterile neutrinos with tritium $\u005cbeta$-decay experiments like KATRIN. They can\u000asignificantly distort the spectral shape and thereby obscure the tiny kink-like\u000asignature of a sterile neutrino. In this work we demonstrate various mitigation\u000atechniques to reduce the impact of ADC non-linearities on the tritium\u000a$\u005cbeta$-decay spectrum to a level of $<$ ppm. The best results are achieved\u000awith a multi-pixel ($\u005cgeq10^4$ pixels) detector using full waveform\u000adigitization. In this case, active-to-sterile mixing angles of the order of\u000a$\u005csin^2 \u005ctheta = 10^{-7}$ would be accessible from the viewpoint of ADC\u000anon-linearities. With purely peak-sensing ADCs a comparable sensitivity could\u000abe reached with highly linear ADCs, sufficient non-linearity corrections or by\u000aincreasing the number of pixels to $\u005cgeq 10^5$.

VThe X-ray source 1E 161348-5055 in the supernova remnant RCW 103 recently\u000aexhibited X-ray activity typical of magnetars, i.e., neutron stars with\u000amagnetic fields > 10^14-10^15 G. However, 1E 161348-5055 has an observed period\u000aof 6.67 hr, in contrast to magnetars which have a spin period of seconds. Here\u000awe describe a simple model which can explain the spin evolution of 1E\u000a161348-5055, as well as other magnetars, from an initial period of milliseconds\u000athat would be required for dynamo generation of magnetar-strength magnetic\u000afields. We propose that the key difference between 1E 161348-5055 and other\u000amagnetars is the persistence of a remnant disk of small total mass. This disk\u000acaused 1E 161348-5055 to undergo ejector and propeller phases in its life,\u000aduring which strong torques caused a rapid increase of its spin period. By\u000amatching its observed spin period and ~1-3 kyr age, we find that 1E 161348-5055\u000ahas the (slightly) highest magnetic field of all known magnetars, with\u000aB~5x10^15 G, and that its disk had a mass of ~10^24 g, comparable to that of\u000athe asteroid Ceres.

VNewly discovered van der Waals materials like MoS$_2$, WSe$_2$, hexagonal\u000aboron nitride (h-BN) and recently C$_2$N have sparked intensive research to\u000aunveil the quantum behavior associated with their 2D topology. Of great\u000ainterest are 2D materials that host single quantum emitters. h-BN, with a\u000aband-gap of 4.6 - 7 eV, has been shown to host single quantum emitters which\u000aare stable at room temperature in the UV and visible spectral range. In this\u000apaper we investigate correlations between h-BN topological features and emitter\u000alocation from bulk down to the mono-layer at room temperature. We demonstrate\u000athat chemical etching and ion irratiation can generate emitters in h-BN. We\u000aanalyze the emitters' spectral features and show that they are dominated by the\u000ainteraction of the electronic transition with single Raman active mode of h-BN.\u000aPhoto-dynamics analysis reveals diverse rates between the electronic states of\u000athe emitter. The emitters show excellent photo stability even under ambient\u000aconditions and in monolayers. Comparing the excitation polarization between\u000adifferent emitters unveils a connection between defect orientation and the h-BN\u000ahexagonal structure. The sharp spectral features, color diversity,\u000aroom-temperature stability, long lived meta-stable states, ease of fabrication,\u000aproximity of the emitters to the environment, outstanding chemical stability\u000aand bio-compatibility of h-BN provide a completely new class of systems that\u000acan be used for sensing and quantum photonics applications.
